    ```
2. **Create a `.env` file**

4. **Set up environment variables:**

    ```bash
    PINECONE_API_KEY = "xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx"
    PINECONE_API_ENV = "xxxxx"

    NEON_USERNAME = "xxxx"
    NEON_PASSWORD = "xxxx"
    NEON_HOST = "xx-xxx-xxxxxx"
    NEON_PORT = "xxxx"
    NEON_PROJECT = "xxxx"
    ```

4. **Download the model from huggingface:**

    *Select the model according to the system requirements if the RAM is less than **16GB** it is advisable to select the lesser bit model such as 2-bit or 4-bit model*

    *The data for the model are multiple pdf's that are store in the folder named **data***
    >Important note the pdf's must be editable not scanned pdf

    *run the following code only once to store the vectors in the Pinecone vector stores*

    ```bash
    python store_index.py
    ```

5. **Run the application:**

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
